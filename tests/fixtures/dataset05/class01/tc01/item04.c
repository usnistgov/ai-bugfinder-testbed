 * @description
 * CWE: 121 Stack Based Buffer Overflow
 * BadSource: rand Set data to result of rand(), which may be zero
 * GoodSource: Larger than zero but less than 10
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: Ensure the array index is valid
 *    BadSink : Improperly check the array index by not checking the upper bound
 * Flow Variant: 07 Control flow: if(staticFive==5) and if(staticFive!=5)
